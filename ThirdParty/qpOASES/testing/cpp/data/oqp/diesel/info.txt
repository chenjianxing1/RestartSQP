Benchmark problem:
==================

diesel


Dimensions:
===========

600 QPs,
20 variables (bounded),
20 constraints,
0 equality constraints



Description:
============

This test problem aims at controlling a real-world direct injection turbo 
charged Diesel engine. The data has been obtained by closed-loop simulations 
using a linear model linearised for an operating area with engine speeds of 
2100-2500 rpm and injected fuel mass of 0-30 mg/stroke. The engine speed as 
well as the amount of injected fuel is kept constant at 2300 rpm and 
15 mg/stroke, respectively and the controller shall track two step changes 
of the setpoints for the mass air flow (MAF) and the intake manifold pressure 
(MAP).

Inputs are the slew rates of the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve and 
the position of the variable geometry turbocharger (VGT). Lower and upper 
bounds on these slew rates as well as on the absolute value of the EGR valve 
and the VGT position are imposed. A control horizon of 10 intervals (each of 
50ms length) and a prediction horizon of 4s had been chosen for a sampling 
rate of 50ms.
